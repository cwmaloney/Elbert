## Notes

1. Jimp uses bitmap fonts in the “AngelCode”, aka BMFont, format

1. I would like to find "hand made" bitmap fonts because vector fonts rendered
at the sizes we need are not very good.

1. For distantly spaced "pixels" and low resultion "screens", I expect anti-aliasing is not going to be helpful

## Tools

do not know what Littera uses as the default font.
