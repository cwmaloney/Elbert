## Notes

1. Jimp uses “AngelCode” fonts, aka BMFonts

1. I would like to find "hand made" bitmap fonts

1. For distantly spaced "pixels" and low resultion "screens", I expect anti-aliasing is not going to be helpful

## Tools

## BMFont

## Hiero
1. Java

## Shoebox
1. Uses Adobe Air - obsolete

## Glyph Designer

## bmGlyph
1. Nice glyphs
1. Outputs text but not xml files
1. Outputs all glyphs are the same size - much bigger that pixel or line height

## Littera
 web site

# Tests

# Version 1
1. Blake created fonts using Littera and the "default" font. I
do not know what Littera uses as the default font.


# Chris tied Littera with Comfortaa from Google Fonts
1. see screen shots for seeting
1. Similar to Blake's fonts
1. Too much gray scale
